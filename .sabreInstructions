HOW TO GET SABRE APIs WORKING

1. Create your Sabre Dev Account here:
    https://beta.developer.sabre.com/user/register

2. Go to the "My Account" page, and select the "Applications" tab.

3. Click "Add New Application" and note the Client ID and the Client Secret that are created.

4. Run this command in your Terminal:
    echo -n `echo -n "Your Client ID" | base64`:`echo -n "Your Client Secret" | base64` |base64

5. Copy the output from the above command.

6. Open Postman and enter in the following:
    a. Select the POST request type.
    b. Request URL: https://api-crt.cert.havail.sabre.com/v2/auth/token
    c. ** Select the "Headers" tab **
    d. Add "Content-Type" (without quotes) as a key, and enter "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" (without quotes) as the value.
    e. Add "Authorization" (without quotes) as a key, and enter what you copied in step 5 above as the value.
    f. ** Select the "Body" tab **
    g. Select the "x-www-form-urlencoded" option on the Body tab.
    h. Add "grant_type" (without quotes) as a key, and enter "client_credentials" (without quotes) as the value.
       In Authorization tab, select "basic" and input Username (Sabre Client ID) and password (Sabre secret code) converted to 64bit base once.
    i.Click the "Send" button.
    j. You should now have a response from Sabre that has an "access-token". If not, get the error and contact me so I can help troubleshoot.
    k. Copy your "access-token"
    l. Enter "Bearer" and then a space, and then the value you copied from step k. above in our .env file for the SABRE_TOKEN value. So the SABRE_TOKEN value should look something like this:
        "Bearer <your token>" (No quotes though)

        You should now be able to use our site/application with your token.


TO MAKE A SABRE API CALL USING POSTMAN

1. Select the GET request type.
2. Enter the request string you wish to send to Sabre.
    a. NOTE: our tokens require the test environment, so the hostname MUST be replaced with "api-crt.cert.havail.sabre.com" in the request URL.
3. On the Authorization tab, select "Bearer Token" as the type, and then on the right side where it says "Token" enter YOUR access_token from step 6k above.
4. Click the "Send" button. You should get the response in the "Body" tab at the bottom of the window.
